        "wivive-des": "ViVEXELT is a project funded by the British Council and supported by the National Foreign Language Project in Vietnam through the ‘Digital Learning Innovation Fund’ initiative that vaims to encourage partnerships between the UK and Vietnam which generate new research, insight and/or innovations to improve the teaching and learning of English. With the impact of Covid-19 on learning, British Council and Vietnam’s National Foreign Languages Project (NFLP) are keen to ensure that future remote and online learning opportunities are more equitable and accessible to all, rather than just a few, and that they are sustainable over time. ViVEXELT addresses ELT capacity building and digital competence enhancement through the creation of cross-sectional ELT networks as communities of practice supported by a Virtual Exchange course. VE enables sustained, technology-enabled, research informed, people-to-people education programmes or activities in which constructive communication and interaction takes place between individuals or groups who are geographically separated and/or from different cultural backgrounds, with the support of educators or facilitators (Helm 2019). The participants are practising English Language teachers and students in teacher education who will reflect ‘in’ action, ‘on’ action’ and ‘for action’ through a VE course, exploring both the local and the global ELT needs and competencies for the 21st century, which has been made more urgent by the COVID 19 Pandemic, forcing many teachers to move to online delivery.",
        "vive-aims": "What ViVEXELT aims to?",
        "vive-aims-des-1": "Develop a novel and sustainable ‘bottom-up’ and inclusive digital model of CPD (Continuous Professional Development) for ELT training/education based on reflective practice through a VE-based online course to support the implementation of the National Foreign Language Project in Vietnam;",
        "vive-aims-des-2": "To create a Vietnam/UK sustainable community of ELT VE practice that will continue after the project ends",
        "vive-aims-des-3": "To support the Vietnamese and UK ELT professionals (both novice and experienced) to develop the interactional and intercultural competencies required to teach online",
        "vive-aims-des-4": "To explore and reflect on innovative digital solutions in ELT, including the repurposing of existing tools and platforms already developed by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) and/or the British Council (e.g. MOOCs for ELT), to support the further development of intercultural communicative competence and the fostering of student-centred ELT pedagogy",
        "vive-aims-des-5": "To create accessible and inclusive CPD digital learning objects (e.g. 5 short videos and 10 online ELT lesson plans), and other ELT-VE guides co-designed and produced by the Vietnamese-UK partners in collaboration with participating teachers and students in teacher education.",
        "who-vive":"Who is ViVEXELT for?",
        "who-vive-des":"ViVEXELT is for teachers and students involved in English Language Teacher Education in the post -18 state sector in the UK and Vietnam. We hope that ViVEXELT will support the creation of a community of ELT practice through Virtual Exchange, where English language teachers can practice interactional and intercultural online skills while also learning more about the theory and practice of English language learning and teaching. Participants will be offered free online courses on ELT theory and practice and will practise them online through Virtual Exchanges between the UK and Vietnam. On successful completion of the VE course, participants will be provided with an official certification of completion approved by the British Council and the National Foreign Language Project. Selected participants will also be offered attendance at a free conference in March 2022. All participating teachers and students in teacher education from Vietnam will be given a small monetary reward for their contribution to the project.",
